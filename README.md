#README Ticket Touting

"Ticket resale (also known as ticket scalping or ticket touting) is the act of reselling tickets for admission to events. Tickets are bought from licensed sellers and are then sold for a price determined by the individual or company in possession of the tickets." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_resale

20 years ago getting tickets was a hassle. The easiest way to acquire them was to call the venue, provide your credit card information, and wait for the tickets to arrive in the mail. Alternatively, you could travel to the venue itself (or a store that was acting as the middle-man) and pray that tickets were still available. 

Thanks to the internet, that marketplace has changed. You can now 
"conveniently" purchase tickets to almost anything as soon as they go on sale. This technological advancement, however, has paradoxically proliferated the painstaking processes of ticket purchasing. Competition in this arena has spiraled, and as consumer we are yet again subject to our society's capitalist nature. For example, tickets are often times sold to individuals (or companies) whose sole intention is to resell them for a profit (if you're not fully convinced read this short article about who tickets go on sale to first and why http://www.today.com/news/why-you-cant-get-tickets-hottest-concerts-6C10505415).

**So just how much money are people making in this industry?** The purpose of this project will be to explore just that. 

As a team we will be collecting data from as many ticket distribution companies as possible. For simplicity we have decided narrow our scope, and will be starting with EDM (electric dance music) concerts. Once we have a firm understand of where to get the data, how to structure it, and what variables to explore, we will analyze additional genres and events. 

# Research Questions:
- In a given quarter what shows'/artists' tickets would resell bring the most profit?
- When is the optimal time to purchase and resell tickets? 

# Hypothesis:
There is an observable ROI (return on investment) pattern for ticket touting.
